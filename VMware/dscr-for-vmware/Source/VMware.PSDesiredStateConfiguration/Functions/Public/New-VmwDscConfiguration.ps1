function New-VmwDscConfiguration {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Compiles a DSC Configuration into a VmwDscConfiguration object, which contains
        the name of the DSC Configuration and the DSC Resources defined in it.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Compiles a DSC Configuration into a VmwDscConfiguration object, which contains
        the name of the DSC Configuration and the DSC Resources defined in it. The provided
        PowerShell script file can contain multiple DSC Configurations in which case the cmdlet
        returns an array of VmwDscConfiguration objects. If the ConfigurationName parameter is specified,
        the cmdlet returns only one VmwDscConfiguration object - the one constructed from the specified
        DSC Configuration.

    .PARAMETER Path
        Specifies a file path of a file that contains DSC Configurations. The file can contain multiple DSC Configurations
        and for each one, a separate VmwDscConfiguration object is created. If ConfigurationData hashtable is defined in the provided
        file, it is passed to each DSC Configuration defined in the file.

    .PARAMETER ConfigurationName
        Specifies the name of the DSC Configuration which should be compiled into a VmwDscConfiguration object. This parameter is applicable
        only when multiple DSC Configurations are defined in the file and only one specific DSC Configuration should be compiled. If not specified,
        all DSC Configurations in the file are compiled and returned as VmwDscConfiguration objects.

    .PARAMETER Parameters
        Specifies the parameters of the file that contains the DSC Configurations as a hashtable
        where each key is the parameter name and each value is the parameter value.

    .EXAMPLE
        Compiles the DSC Configurations defined in the vSphere_Config file located in the current directory.

        PS> $dscConfigs = New-VmwDscConfiguration -Path .\vSphere_Config.ps1

    .EXAMPLE
        Compiles the DSC Configuration vSphereNode_Config defined in the vSphere_Config file located in the current directory
        and passes the VMHostName parameter to the vSphere_Config file.

        PS> $dscConfig = New-VmwDscConfiguration -Path .\vSphere_Config.ps1 -ConfigurationName 'vSphereNode_Config' -Parameters @{ VMHostName = 'MyVMHost' }
